    "Your superiors have outlined this year's strategy for the company:\n",
    "1. Develop an algorithm to reliably estimate the value of residential houses based on *fixed* characteristics.\n",
    "2. Identify characteristics of houses that the company can cost-effectively change/renovate with their construction team.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the mean dollar value of different renovations.\n",

    "    housing.csv\n",
    "    data_description.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "You need to build a reliable estimator for the price of the house given characteristics of the house that cannot be renovated. Some examples include:\n",
    "- The neighborhood\n",
    "- Square feet\n",
    "- Bedrooms, bathrooms\n",
    "- Basement and garage space\n",
    "\n",
    "and many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of things that **ARE renovate-able:**\n",
    "- Roof and exterior features\n",
    "- \"Quality\" metrics, such as kitchen quality\n",
    "- \"Condition\" metrics, such as condition of garage\n",
    "- Heating and electrical components\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goals:**\n",
    "1. Perform any cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA you deem necessary.\n",
    "- Be sure to remove any houses that are not residential from the dataset.\n",
    "- Identify **fixed** features that can predict price.\n",
    "- Train a model on pre-2010 data and evaluate its performance on the 2010 houses.\n",
    "- Characterize your model. How well does it perform? What are the best estimates of price?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The EDA and feature engineering component to this project is not trivial! Be sure to always think critically and creatively. Justify your actions! Use the data description file!"
