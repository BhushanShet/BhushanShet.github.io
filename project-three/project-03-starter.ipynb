    "Your superiors have outlined this year's strategy for the company:\n",
    "1. Develop an algorithm to reliably estimate the value of residential houses based on *fixed* characteristics.\n",
    "2. Identify characteristics of houses that the company can cost-effectively change/renovate with their construction team.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the mean dollar value of different renovations.\n",

    "Then we can use that to buy houses that are likely to sell for more than the cost of the purchase plus renovations.\n",

    "\n",
    "    housing.csv\n",
    "    data_description.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "You need to build a reliable estimator for the price of the house given characteristics of the house that cannot be renovated. Some examples include:\n",
    "- The neighborhood\n",
    "- Square feet\n",
    "- Bedrooms, bathrooms\n",
    "- Basement and garage space\n",
    "\n",
    "and many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of things that **ARE renovate-able:**\n",
    "- Roof and exterior features\n",
    "- \"Quality\" metrics, such as kitchen quality\n",
    "- \"Condition\" metrics, such as condition of garage\n",
    "- Heating and electrical components\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goals:**\n",
    "1. Perform any cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA you deem necessary.\n",
    "- Be sure to remove any houses that are not residential from the dataset.\n",
    "- Identify **fixed** features that can predict price.\n",
    "- Train a model on pre-2010 data and evaluate its performance on the 2010 houses.\n",
    "- Characterize your model. How well does it perform? What are the best estimates of price?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The EDA and feature engineering component to this project is not trivial! Be sure to always think critically and creatively. Justify your actions! Use the data description file!"
